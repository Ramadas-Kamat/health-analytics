Some samples of my work in healthcare data analytics/data science using R, python and Java

I have included source code for some of my work using statistical modeling, machinelearning and data munging code mostly written using R, some python and Java.

This repository is mostly to showcase some of my work for recruitment purposes but is free-to-use if you like it.

The work is divided into three folder:

1) Data munging and pattern search.

2) Predictive analytics using machine learning algorithms.

3) NLP and Text analysis using LDA, Topic analysis etc.
